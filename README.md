# Fighting Game Notation Converter

This is a tool to convert fighting game inputs between different game notations. It breaks down directional + attack inputs (e.g., `214D`) into a neutral format, then converts that into a specific game's format. Useful for sharing combos across games like **Tekken**, **BlazBlue**, and others.
